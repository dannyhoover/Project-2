## Installation

You can follow this heroku link to access [this page](https://project-2-fsbc.herokuapp.com/)
Also, you can go to the following github link and [download](https://github.com/dannyhoover/Project-2) all files. Once files are download install the 
dependencies located in the package.json file.  

## Usuage
Once on the home page you can enter what food you'd like to search for and the API will spit out recipes on cards you can choose from.  We plan in the future to add logic to 
allow for user to have their own account what saved recipes they have search for in the past.
